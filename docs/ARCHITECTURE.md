# Architecture

> **Status:** Planned for the standalone Applied ML submission. This architecture follows `docs/PROJECT_SPEC.md` and the explicit organizer runtime/submission constraints.

## 1. Technology stack

### Frontend

None in the MVP. The evaluator calls the Python function directly. A Streamlit demonstration dashboard is an optional stretch only after the submission pipeline is working; it is not included in the portal ZIP.

### Backend

No HTTP server or API service. The submission is a Python 3.12.14 module exposing `solution.py:decide(observation, state)`. Offline training and validation use Python with NumPy and scikit-learn from the approved environment. Inference uses the submitted Python source, NumPy, and a JSON parameter file; estimator objects are not serialized.

### Database

None. The evaluator supplies each observation and resets state per case. Public training data is read locally during development; the submission contains only source and model parameters.

### External APIs and services

None. Evaluation has no direct network access. No gateway, credentials, paid services, or third-party data are required.

### Local development tooling

- Python 3.12.14.
- Approved packages: `numpy==2.3.4`, `pandas==2.3.3`, `scipy==1.18.1`, `scikit-learn==1.7.2`, `joblib==1.6.0`, `cloudpickle==3.1.2`, `python-dateutil==3.0.0`, `pytz==2026.6`, `tzdata==2026.6`, `six==1.17.0`, and `threadpoolctl==3.7.0`. Import scikit-learn as `sklearn` and python-dateutil as `dateutil`. The project needs NumPy and scikit-learn; do not install or bundle any additional third-party package.
- Linux/Docker isolated evaluation; 2 CPUs, 2 GiB RAM, no direct network, read-only source/public files, writable temporary storage; 120 seconds per response, 1,200 seconds per run, 1 MiB JSON frame.
- Supplied `Initial-Data/local_check.py`, `training.json.gz`, `practice.json.gz`, `smoke.json.gz`, and scoring/data documentation.
- Standard-library `unittest` for focused feature and contract tests.
- Run checks from the repository root, for example: `python Initial-Data/local_check.py --solution submission/solution.py --data Initial-Data/smoke.json.gz`.
- Do not modify or overwrite the supplied `Initial-Data/` or `Submission-Format/` packets. Training scripts write generated JSON parameters under `submission/`.

## 2. System overview

Offline development fits a compact repeat-probability head and capped-value head on the public training partition, validates them with grouped splits, and exports numeric parameters as JSON. During evaluation, the platform passes an observation to `submission/solution.py`; it builds causal features from the raw transaction rows, loads its adjacent JSON parameters, and returns the exact action/state contract. There is no browser, server, database, or network call.

```

## 3. Component responsibilities

| Component | Responsibility | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `submission/features.py` | Clean/join raw history to the authoritative roster and create causal customer features. | Lavesh |
| `tools/validate_baseline.py` | Reproduce the supplied baseline and establish grouped validation without modifying supplied files. | Veer |
| `tools/train_model.py` | Fit and compare model heads with grouped validation; export JSON coefficients/scales. | Veer |
| `submission/solution.py` | Load parameters relative to `__file__`, invoke feature generation, validate bounds, and form the fixed-budget action. | Soorya |
| `tests/` and supplied local checker | Verify feature edge cases, output contract, and public score. | Assigned per task; Soorya integrates |
| `tools/package_submission.py` | Build and verify a flat, size-limited ZIP from submission files only. | Soorya |

## 4. Project folder structure

```text
docs/                       Shared product, architecture, contract, and task docs
roles/                      Team role instructions
Initial-Data/               Supplied read-only data, starter, checker, and rules
Submission-Format/          Supplied read-only example package
submission/                 Final inference source and JSON parameters
  solution.py
  features.py
  starter_model.json
  README.md                  Optional; included only if useful
tools/                      Offline fitting, validation, and ZIP tooling (not required in ZIP)
  validate_baseline.py
  train_model.py
  package_submission.py
tests/                      Standard-library focused tests (not required in ZIP)
```

The ZIP is assembled from the contents of `submission/`, so its root contains `solution.py`, every imported/read helper and parameter, and optionally `README.md`; it does not contain the `submission/` directory itself. Training data and development tools are never included.

## 5. Data flow

1. Offline fitting reads only the public training partition. Validation folds keep documented source/world groups together; the practice set is used as a limited final public comparison, not repeatedly tuned.
2. The evaluator passes the observation roster, dates, budget, and raw transactions to `decide`; no labels are passed to inference.
3. Feature generation joins only on supplied customer IDs, filters rows to the available history before `observed_until`, and distinguishes positive purchases from returns/cancellations. Exact repeated source rows are de-duplicated for aggregates using the eight original fields, excluding `source_row`.
4. The model predicts repeat probability and unconditional capped purchase value for each roster customer. Predictions are bounded to the contract ranges.
5. The selector ranks predicted capped value and returns exactly the supplied number of distinct eligible customer IDs.

### Frozen feature and parameter interface

`submission/features.py` exposes `FEATURE_NAMES` and `matrix(observation)`. The matrix is a finite NumPy `float64` array with shape `(len(observation["customers"]), 9)` in exactly the roster order. The frozen feature order reuses the supplied baseline contract:

| Zero-based column | Feature | Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | `recency` | Days from `snapshot` to the latest qualifying positive-purchase line; use 180 when none exists. |
| 1 | `invoice_frequency` | Count of distinct invoice numbers containing qualifying positive-purchase lines. |
| 2 | `recent_value` | Sum of qualifying positive line values with age at most 30 days before `snapshot`. |
| 3 | `older_value` | Sum of qualifying positive line values with age greater than 30 days before `snapshot`. |
| 4 | `basket_value` | Total qualifying positive line value divided by `max(1, invoice_frequency)`. |
| 5 | `return_ratio` | Absolute value of historical lines marked by negative quantity or a C/c invoice prefix, divided by `max(1, total qualifying positive value)`. |
| 6 | `cadence` | Mean days between distinct qualifying purchase invoice dates; use 90 when fewer than two dates exist. |
| 7 | `tenure` | Days from the oldest qualifying positive-purchase line to `snapshot`; use 180 when none exists. |
| 8 | `observed_gap` | Days between `observed_until` and `snapshot`. |

The baseline log-transforms zero-based columns 1–4 with `log1p(max(0, x))`; training-fitted means and scales are stored in the JSON model and reused at inference. Invalid/missing dates do not contribute to time-based features. Return/cancellation lines may contribute to `return_ratio` but never to positive purchase totals.

The JSON model contains `feature_names`, `mean` (nine numbers), `scale` (nine positive numbers), `repeat` (`intercept` plus nine `coefficients`), and `value` (`intercept` plus nine `coefficients`). `repeat` is fit as logistic regression; `value` is ridge regression on capped target value normalized by 2000. Inference applies the sigmoid and linear value head, multiplies the normalized value by 2000, clips to the contract ranges, and selects descending predicted value with customer ID ascending as a deterministic tie-break. Both heads are exported as plain JSON numeric parameters, never as a serialized estimator.

## 6. Authentication and authorization

Not required. There is no application server, user account, private API, or external service. The evaluator invokes the submitted function in an isolated runtime.

## 7. Architecture decisions and rationale

| Decision | Alternatives considered | Why we chose it | Date |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Single offline Python submission; no web app or service | Conventional frontend/backend/API deployment | The evaluator invokes a Python function directly; extra infrastructure cannot improve the task score and risks the deadline. | 2026-11-05 |
| Use compact linear model heads: scikit-learn logistic regression for repeat and ridge regression for capped value; export transforms/coefficients to JSON and compute predictions with NumPy | Pickle/joblib estimators, large tree ensembles, or fitting during inference | Approved libraries support offline fitting, while JSON parameters are permitted, portable, small, and do not require model deserialization in the isolated runner. Compare against the supplied ridge baseline with grouped validation before choosing final parameters. | 2026-11-05 |
| Keep training and packaging tools outside `submission/`; keep submission files flat inside the ZIP | Bundle datasets/notebooks or zip an enclosing folder | Meets the no-dataset/no-subfolder constraints and keeps the inference artifact small. | 2026-11-05 |
| No database, environment variables, authentication, or external APIs | Local persistence and hosted services | Observations and parameters are supplied directly; none of these services are required. | 2026-11-05 |

## 8. Technical risks and limitations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Leakage from records at/after `observed_until` or from random splits across related examples | Inflated local validation and poor hidden-cohort performance | Enforce the cutoff in feature code and use grouped validation based on the supplied source/world grouping metadata. |
| Seven-day unavailable tail and messy duplicate/return/cancellation rows | Incorrect recency, frequency, or value features | Treat the tail as unknown; test exact deduplication and purchase predicates; preserve returns/cancellations only as historical evidence. |
| Small public sample and repeated practice tuning | Overfit model selection | Keep an untouched grouped training holdout and limit practice comparisons; compare against the starter baseline. |
| Heavy-tailed capped value and narrow time budget | Unstable value predictions or incomplete integration | Deliver a runnable candidate by 14:15 IST for the team's test; use its results to prioritize fixes, bound predictions, compare against the starter, and reserve time for post-twist retesting. |
| JSON artifact/path/ZIP contract errors or runtime overrun | Compatibility failure or lost attempt | Read artifacts relative to `__file__`; test the exact flat ZIP; run the supplied checker on smoke, training, and practice before upload. |

## 9. Environment variables

None. The submission needs no secrets, service URLs, or configurable runtime environment values.
